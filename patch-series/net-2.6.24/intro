CAN: Add new PF_CAN protocol family, try #6
ESUBJECT

Hello Dave,

this is the patch series that adds the PF_CAN
protocol family for the Controller Area Network.

Since our last post we have changed the following:

* Typos in documentation as pointd out by Randy Dunlap.

The changes in try #6 were:

* Update code to work with namespaces in net-2.6.24.
* Remove SET_MODULE_OWNER() from vcan.

The changes in try #5 were:

* Remove slab destructor from calls to kmem_cache_alloc().
* Add comments about types defined in can.h.
* Update comment on vcan loopback module parameter.
* Fix typo in documentation.

The changes in try #4 were:

* Change vcan network driver to use the new RTNL API, as suggested by
  Patrick.
* Revert our change to use skb->iif instead of skb->cb.  After
  discussion with Patrick and Jamal it turned out, our first
  implementation was correct.
* Use skb_tail_pointer() instead of skb->tail directly.
* Coding style changes to satisfy linux/scripts/checkpatch.pl.
* Minor changes for 64-bit-cleanliness.
* Minor cleanup of #include's

The changes in try #3 were:

* Use sbk->sk and skb->pkt_type instead of skb->cb to pass loopback
  flags and originating socket down to the driver and back to the
  receiving socket.  Thanks to Patrick McHardy for pointing out our
  wrong use of sbk->cb.
* Use skb->iif instead of skb->cb to pass receiving interface from
  raw_rcv() and bcm_rcv() up to raw_recvmsg() and bcm_recvmsg().
* Set skb->protocol when sending CAN frames to netdevices.
* Removed struct raw_opt and struct bcm_opt and integrated these
  directly into struct raw_sock and bcm_sock resp., like most other
  proto implementations do.
* We have found and fixed race conditions between raw_bind(),
  raw_{set,get}sockopt() and raw_notifier().  This resulted in
  - complete removal of our own notifier list infrastructure in
    af_can.c.  raw.c and bcm.c now use normal netdevice notifiers.
  - removal of ro->lock spinlock.  We use lock_sock(sk) now.
  - changed deletion of dev_rcv_lists, which are now marked for
    deletion in the netdevice notifier in af_can.c and are actually
    deleted when all entries have been deleted using can_rx_unregister().
* Follow changes in 2.6.22 (e.g. ktime_t timestamps in skb).
* Removed obsolete code from vcan.c, as pointed out by Stephen Hemminger.

The changes in try #2 were:

* reduced RCU callback overhead when deleting receiver lists (thx to
  feedback from Paul E. McKenney).
* eliminated some code duplication in net/can/proc.c.
* renamed slock-29 and sk_lock-29 to slock-AF_CAN and sk_lock-AF_CAN in
  net/core/sock.c
* added entry for can.txt in Documentation/networking/00-INDEX
* added error frame definitions in include/linux/can/error.h, which are to
  be used by CAN network drivers.


This patch series applies against net-2.6.24 and is derived from Subversion
revision r469 of http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan.
It can be found in the directory
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/patch-series/<version>.

This patch doesn't touch anything in the kernel except for the allocation
of a couple of numbers for protocol, arp hw type, and a line discipline.

Please review this patch series for integration into your tree.

Thanks very much for your work!

Best regards,

Urs Thuermann
